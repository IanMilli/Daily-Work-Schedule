# week-7-Work-Place-Calender-and-Scheduler
This is a project to use Jquery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and the moments library to create a daily planner for scheduling work tasks and meetings over hourly slots.

## Description 

The project is a work schedule planning app that allows users to enter their daily tasks and save them. 
The information the user stores in the planner will remain there until they clear it even if the page refreshes.
Once the tasks are completed the user can remove the details of the task using a clear button.
